# Calculator

#### A simple calculator application.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Description

This simple calculator app allows users to input two numbers which will then be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. A window alert displays the sum of the two numbers for each function.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Known Bugs

Although the app is functional, it lacks any kind of visual design. I plan to add this once I gain more knowledge on styling in CSS. I also plan to add more advanced functions as I gain more knowledge of JavaScript functions.
